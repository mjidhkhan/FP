# Beginners Laravel Learning Project 
This project is for laravel bignners.
### Learning Laravel
A simple CRUD application using laravel 6.x For those who wnat to learn Laravel.

### Creating Controllers and Models 

Create Controllers and Models using Laravel's **commandline** utility **artisan** which shipped with Laravel and installed with laravel installation.


### Create Controller using php artisan
 Controllers can be created using **php artisan** as follows
 ```shell
 $ php artisan make:controller CustomersController
 ```
### Create Model using php artisan
 ```shell
 $ php artisan make:model Customers
 ```
 If used with **-m** flag it will create migration also
 ```shell
 $ php artisan make:model Customers -m
 ```
### Create Migrations using php artisan
 ```shell
 $ php artisan make:migration Customers
 ```

 Both can be done in one go with migration as well.
 ```shell
 $ php artisan make:model Customers -mc
 ```

 It will create file inside **databse/migration** with name like this 
 > *2019_10_16_142245_create_customers_table.php*

with some biolerplate code like this
```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

class CreateCustomersTable extends Migration
{
    /**
     * Run the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('customers', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->bigIncrements('id');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reverse the migrations.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function down()
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('customers');
    }
}

```


 ### Adding Route in web.php

 To add new **Route**  open file inside **resources/web.php** and add code as given below.
 ```php
 Route::get('customers', 'CustomersController@index');
 ```
 considering we created a controller for customers and its called **CustomersController**
 
 
Controllers are added in floowing path **app/Http**
we add index method as follows
```php
public function index()
    {
        $activecustomers = Customer::active()->get();
        $inactivecustomers = Customer::inactive()->get();
        return view('customers.customers',compact('activecustomers','inactivecustomers'));
    }
```
The above function is getting active and inactive customers.
We use Laravel scoping facility to create **active()** and **inactive()** methods which we creat in **Customer Model**

Little on Scoping and how to create scpoe metnod bellow is an example.
```php
public function scopeActive($query)
    {
        return $query->where('active', 1);
    }
    public function scopeInactive($query)
    {
        return $query->where('active', 0);
    }
```
Above are two scope methods we use in our **Customer Model**.

### More here [Later]

### Creating Company Model
Run following command 
```php 
$ php artisan make:model Company -m
```
It will create Model and migration in one go.

Open migration file **2019_10_17_100119_create_companies_table.php**
Look at the **up** function. It will be like this 
```php
 public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('companies', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->bigIncrements('id');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
```
Now we will add two more fields as **name** and **phone**
```php

$table->string('name');
$table->string('phone');
```
Whole function would be like this
```php
public function up()
    {
        Schema::create('companies', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->bigIncrements('id');
			$table->string('name');
			$table->string('phone');
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
```

**[Remeber Don't forget $fillable=[] fields ]**

Open Model file **Company.php** inside **app** directory
and add **$fillable**
```php
class Company extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'phone'];
}
```

[Remember you create migration but this migration does not create table in database. It only created schema for the database.]

### Creating table in database
To create table in databas Run following command.
```shell
$ php artisan migrate
```
It will check migrations and if found any changes it will run migration.
Definately there is change and there is new migration for Company so it will create **companies** table in database and will leave all previous migrations as is.

### Laravel tinker

Tinker is python shell from where app can execute specially Database operation.

To run **tinker** use following command
```shell
$ php artisan tinker

Psy Shell v0.9.9 (PHP 7.3.10 â€” cli) by Justin Hileman
>>>
```

It will bring in python shell **>>>** like this. To exit tinker type **exit**

 To run **Company model** write folowing in python shell
 ```python
 >>> $c= new App\Compnay();
 => App\Company {#3003}
 ```
 Create Company using tinker
 ```python
 >>> $cr= Company::create(['name'=>'ABC Company', 'phone'=>'123-123-1234'])
 ```
 Result:
 ```python 
 [!] Aliasing 'Company' to 'App\Company' for this Tinker session.
=> App\Company {#3011
     name: "ABC Company",
     phone: "123-123-1234",
     updated_at: "2019-10-17 10:39:55",
     created_at: "2019-10-17 10:39:55",
     id: 1,
   }
>>> 
 ```
So Company ABC created in database.

Still lot more left to do in laravel Learning process.
We work normally dont rush.
